            <p>MSEA came to me with the desire to modernize their outreach in terms of their branding and website. When
              they told me they had to submit a ticket to someone 3,000 miles away to make a small change to a page, I
              immediately told them I could help make their lives so much easier with WordPress. </p>

            <p>We worked through creating a new logo to go along with their site redesign. And once that was finalized,
              I worked to give them a site they were proud to show off to current, old, and future members.
            </p>

            <h3>My favorite part: </h3>
            <p>This project was my first freelance project, so the idea of building it on my own was daunting But, once
              it was finished it I felt ready to tackle even more clients. If you want to be one, give me a call!</p>
