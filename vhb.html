          </div>
          <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">

            <p>VHB is a large engineering firm on the east coast who came to High Monkey for help in designing their
              public site in SharePoint. They wanted the site to focus on the stories their company created, whether it
              was a project they completed or an award they received. </p>

            <p>We wanted to come up with a way to showcase their large project images in different ways. The homepage
              uses a collage-like arrangement of images, while project pages make use of a carousel rotator.
            </p>

            <h3>My favorite part: </h3>
            <p>This project was one of my favorite builds at High Monkey, but my favorite part about the design is the
              different collage layouts with overlays.</p>
              <h3>Skills I used: </h3>
              <p>UI, HTML, CSS, Sharepoint</p>
